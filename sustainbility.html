            <p>
                Since 1855, Samuel has understood that true success comes from focusing on the people and places that make our work possible - a principle that 
                supports our vision for sustained growth. We are committed to supporting and protecting the communities we operate in, helping our people grow and 
                develop and continuing to be a truster partner to our customer and suppliers.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Our five core values - Integrity, Respect, Agility, Courage, and Ownership - are the foundation of everything we do. They guide our high ethical 
                standards, help ensure a safe and productive environment for our team, drive our focus on reducing our environmental impact, and support our 
                commitment to giving back. This integrated approach is how we build a stronger, more responsible future and create meaningful impact across our 
                businesses.

                            We know that an important part of being a sustainable 
                            business is ensuring we are always operating honestly and 
                            doing the right thing. In fact, integrity is one of our five 
                            core values (along with respect, agility, courage and 
                            ownership). While this information is not publicly 
                            disclosed, we do have a number of robust ethic controls

                            the success of our business, we also recognize the

                            right thing, we require our team members and our partners 
                            to review and acknowledge our Code of Conduct on 
                            an annual basis. Internally, this is also supplemented with

            <h2>Environment</h2>
            <p>
                With over 70 locations across North America, Samuel requires significant energy to remain operational. That's why we're committed to using the 
                cleanest energy, wherever possible, to both safeguard the environment and ensure the longevity of our business. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond energy, we have several waste reduction projects underway. We engage in traditional methods like recycling, and find innovative ways to reuse 
                items, such as donating old hardware. Plus, our team is always exploring new ways to minimize our environmental footprint.
